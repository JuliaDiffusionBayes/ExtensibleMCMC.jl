[NOTE this package is currently under development]

[ExtensibleMCMC.jl](https://JuliaDiffusionBayes.github.io/ExtensibleMCMC.jl/dev)
- provides a modular implementation of the **Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** algorithm
- comes with essential functionality that you'd expect from your MCMC sampler
- is designed to be easily extensible by the users with their own specialized MCMC steps

A case in point is [DiffusionMCMC.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffusionBayes/DiffusionMCMC.jl), in which `ExtensibleMCMC.jl` is used to define inference algorithms for diffusion processes.

Please see the [documentation](https://JuliaDiffusionBayes.github.io/ExtensibleMCMC.jl/dev) to learn more about this package.
